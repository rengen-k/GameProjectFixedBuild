### Description

The game is a level based puzzle platformer that combines intelligent puzzle solving and precision platforming in various ways to create unique gameplay experiences.

The camera dictates player movement, player rotation, and also reveals parts of the level that are not viewable unless rotated to. This can reveal specific puzzle pieces, new parts of the level to explore, hidden secrets, and things to collect.

### Instructions on How to Play

Move the Player and rotate the camera to solve the puzzles presented to you during the level. As you progress, you may collect the golden collectibles if you wish. Touch the Cyan block at the end of the level to continue to the next level.
To switch between levels, access the Pause Menu screen by pressing Backspace.

### Known Bugs:

It is possible for the menu screen button text to become invisible during full screen mode.
